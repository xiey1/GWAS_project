# GWAS_project
Final project for Quantitative Genomics and Genetics course 

# Aim:
Find the positions of causal polymorphisms for the five expressed genes.
### The data:
<br>`phenotypes.csv` contains the phenotype data for 344 samples and 5 genes.
<br>`genotypes.csv` contains the SNP data for 344 samples and 50000 genotypes.
<br>`gene_info.csv` contains information about each gene that was measured.
<br>`SNP info.csv` contains the additional information on the genotypes and has four columns.

# 1. Check the distribution of the phenotype file
## 1.1 check the distribution of relative gene expression for each gene
<br>Here the phenotype data includes the relative gene expression data for 5 genes: *ERAP2*, *PEX6*, *FAHD1*, *GFM1* and *MARCH7*.
